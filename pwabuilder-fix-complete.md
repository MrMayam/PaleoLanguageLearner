# PWABuilder Fix Complete - Hebrew Basics

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Corrupted PNG Icons Fixed
**Problem:** PWABuilder was getting "read requests waiting on finished stream" errors due to corrupted PNG files
**Solution:** Created valid PNG icons using proper PNG format structure

### 2. Manifest Icon References Updated
**Problem:** Manifest was referencing SVG icons, PWABuilder prefers PNG for app packaging
**Solution:** Updated all icon references in manifest.json to use PNG format:
- Main icons: 192x192, 512x512 with "any" and "maskable" purposes
- Additional sizes: 144x144, 96x96
- Shortcuts icons: All using 96x96 PNG

### 3. Share Target Route Added
**Problem:** Manifest declared share target but no server route existed
**Solution:** Added `/share` POST endpoint that handles shared content and redirects appropriately

### 4. Removed Invalid Screenshots
**Problem:** Referenced screenshot file that didn't exist
**Solution:** Removed screenshots section from manifest to prevent 404 errors

## Files Updated

### client/public/manifest.json
